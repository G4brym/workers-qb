# workers-qb

Zero dependencies Query Builder for [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

This module provides a simple standardized interface while keeping the benefits and speed of using raw queries over a
traditional ORM.

`workers-qb` is not intended to provide ORM-like functionality, rather to make it easier to interact with the database
from code for direct SQL access using convenient wrapper methods.

Currently, 2 databases are supported:

- [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)
- [PostgreSQL (using node-postgres)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/connect-to-postgres/)
