# PostgreSQL

## Create a database

After creating your database, you must allow access from outside the private network, due to limitations on accessing
databases behind [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/).

Your Database URL should be accessible inside the worker, using this format
`postgresql://user:password@hostname:5432/db_name`

The best way is to define it as a secret like this:

```bash
wrangler secret put DB_URL
```

You may also define it as a variable in the `wrangler.toml`, but this is not recommended

```
----
filename: wrangler.toml
----

[vars]
DB_URL = "postgresql://user:password@hostname:5432/db_name"
```

## Setting up the Worker

You must also enable `node_compat = true` in your `wrangler.toml`

```
----
filename: wrangler.toml
----

node_compat = true
```

You need to install `node-postgres`:

```bash
npm install pg --save
```

## Write queries within your Worker

Remember to close the connection using `ctx.waitUntil(qb.close());` or `await qb.close();` at the end of your request.
You may also reuse this connection to execute multiple queries, or share it between multiple requests if you are using
a connection pool in front of your PostgreSQL.

```ts
import { PGQB } from 'workers-qb'
import { Client } from 'pg'

export interface Env {
  DB_URL: string
}

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    const qb = new PGQB(new Client(env.DB_URL))
    await qb.connect()

    const fetched = await qb
      .fetchOne({
        tableName: 'employees',
        fields: 'count(*) as count',
        where: {
          conditions: 'active = ?1',
          params: [true],
        },
      })
      .execute()

    ctx.waitUntil(qb.close())
    return Response.json({
      activeEmployees: fetched.results?.count || 0,
    })
  },
}
```
